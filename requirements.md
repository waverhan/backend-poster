# E-commerce PWA Integrated with POS - Requirements Document

## 1. Document Header
*   **Document Title:** E-commerce PWA Integrated with POS - Requirements Document
*   **Version:** 1.0
*   **Date:** May 22, 2025
*   **Author:** [Your Name/Title - Senior Business Analyst]

## 2. Project Overview

### 2.1. Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to develop a Progressive Web Application (PWA) based e-commerce platform that is seamlessly integrated with the existing Point of Sale (POS) system. This platform will serve as a new sales channel, allowing customers to conveniently browse products, place orders online, and choose between delivery and local pickup from one of the six branch locations in Kyiv.

### 2.2. Goals
*   Expand sales reach by providing an online ordering channel accessible via mobile and web.
*   Streamline order processing by automatically sending online orders to the relevant branch's POS system.
*   Enhance customer experience through easy browsing, ordering, location-based services, and timely order notifications.
*   Maintain data consistency by synchronizing product and customer information with the POS system.
*   Enable operational efficiency by leveraging location-based order routing.

### 2.3. Scope
The project includes the development of a customer-facing PWA for browsing products, placing orders, managing accounts, and receiving notifications. It also includes the necessary backend integration with the POS system via API for fetching product data, potentially updating products, fetching/updating client data, and sending order information. The scope covers implementing location-based logic for branch assignment, managing delivery and pickup options, calculating delivery fees, and implementing a notification system. The scope *does not* explicitly include a dedicated administrative interface for the PWA beyond potential product modification capabilities if required; core management is assumed to be via the POS where possible.

### 2.4. Target Users
*   **End Customers:** Individuals using the PWA to browse products, place orders for delivery or pickup, and track order status.
*   **Branch Staff:** Personnel at the six Kyiv branches who receive and process orders submitted through the POS system, fulfilling pickup and delivery orders.
*   **POS Administrators:** Personnel responsible for managing products, prices, and core business logic within the existing POS system. (Note: PWA admin functions are limited per scope).

## 3. Functional Requirements

**FR-1: Product Catalog Display**
*   **Description:** The PWA shall display a catalog of products available for purchase.
*   **Details:** Products, including names, descriptions, prices, and images, shall be fetched from the POS system via API. Users should be able to browse the catalog.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   FR-1.1: Users can view a list of available products on the homepage or a dedicated products page.
    *   FR-1.2: Each product listing displays the product name, price, and an image (if available).
    *   FR-1.3: Clicking a product displays a detailed product page with full description, price, and additional images (if available).
    *   FR-1.4: Products are dynamically fetched from the POS API upon PWA load or navigation.

**FR-2: Product Search and Filtering**
*   **Description:** Users shall be able to search for products by name or keyword and potentially filter by categories (if supported by POS API).
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   FR-2.1: A search bar is available allowing users to enter keywords.
    *   FR-2.2: Search results display products matching the search query.
    *   FR-2.3: (Optional, based on POS API) Users can filter products by category.

**FR-3: Product Data Modification (Admin - Clarification Needed)**
*   **Description:** Provide capability to "change" products. This likely implies an administrative function for the PWA or sync *from* the PWA back to POS. *Needs clarification on who makes changes and where.*
*   **Assumption:** This refers to the ability for an *administrator* using a separate interface (potentially part of the PWA backend) to make minor overrides or additions *not* managed solely in the POS, which then sync or are used by the PWA. *Alternatively, this could mean enriching data fetched from POS within the PWA system.* Let's document the latter as the most likely interpretation based on "fetch products and if needed we have to ability to change."
*   **Details:** The PWA system shall allow for enrichment or minor overrides of product data fetched from the POS, such as adding richer descriptions, different images, or SEO metadata that the POS API may not provide.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   FR-3.1: An administrator interface (separate from the customer PWA) exists to view products synced from the POS.
    *   FR-3.2: Administrators can add/modify specific fields for products (e.g., long description, multiple images, tags) that are stored within the PWA system and displayed instead of or in addition to POS data.
    *   FR-3.3: Changes made in the PWA admin do not overwrite core product data (price, quantity) in the POS unless specifically designed. *Needs confirmation of exact requirement.*

**FR-4: User Authentication and Profile**

*   **Details:** The calculation logic is:
        *   0 km up to and including 3 km: 99 UAH flat fee.
        *   Distance over 3 km: 99 UAH + (Distance in km - 3) * 30 UAH per km.
        *   Distance measurement should ideally use driving distance via a mapping service API (e.g., Google Maps API).
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   FR-9.1: Upon selecting 'Delivery' and providing an address, the system calculates the distance from the selected branch.
    *   FR-9.2: The delivery fee is calculated accurately based on the specified tiered structure (0-3km @ 99 UAH, >3km @ 99 UAH + 30 UAH/km over 3km).
    *   FR-9.3: The calculated delivery fee is clearly displayed to the user before they confirm the order and proceed to payment.
    *   FR-9.4: The calculated fee is added to the total order cost.
    *   *Note:* Clarification on how distance is measured (straight line vs. driving route) is needed, defaulting to driving route for accuracy. The exact logic for the 2-3km range should be confirmed, assuming 0-3km is covered by the base 99 UAH.
