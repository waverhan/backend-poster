## 2. Project Summary

**Project Goal:**
Develop a Progressive Web Application (PWA) e-commerce platform seamlessly integrated with the existing POS system API. The PWA will serve as an online storefront, allowing customers to view products, place orders, and choose between delivery and pickup from one of our 6 Kyiv branches. Key features include fetching product/client data from the POS, submitting orders to the POS, location-based order routing to the nearest branch, dynamic delivery cost calculation, and client order notifications.
