2. Enter admin password
3. Click **Price Sync** tab
4. Click **Import New Products** (Green button)
5. Wait for completion

### Step 3: Check Results ✅
Look for response like:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "New products import completed! Added X new products.",
  "stats": {
    "new_products": X,
    "skipped_products": Y,
    "errors": 0
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Verify in Database 🔍

3. Verify they have:
   - Correct name
   - Correct price
   - Category assigned
   - Active status

### Step 5: Monitor Logs 📊
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Select your project
3. Check logs for success messages

## Troubleshooting
