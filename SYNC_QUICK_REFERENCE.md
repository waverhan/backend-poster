## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If prices don't update
- Check if prices actually changed in Poster POS
- Verify Poster API token is valid
- Check server logs in Railway

### If products don't import
- Check if new products exist in Poster POS
- Verify they're not already in database
- Check server logs for detailed errors

### If inventory doesn't sync
- Inventory still auto-syncs every 15 minutes
- Check if it's within business hours (8 AM - 10 PM)
- Check server logs for errors
