# Product Requirements Document: PWA E-commerce Integrated with POS

## 1. Document Header

*   **Version:** 1.0
*   **Date:** May 22, 2025
*   **Product Name:** [Your Company Name] Online Store PWA
*   **Author:** [Your Name/Product Team]

## 2. Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for building a Progressive Web Application (PWA) e-commerce platform tightly integrated with our existing Point of Sale (POS) system. The PWA will serve as our primary online sales channel, allowing customers in Kyiv to browse products, place orders for delivery or pickup from one of our 6 branches, and receive notifications regarding their order status. Products and customer data will be sourced from the POS via API, with an option for administrative overrides on the PWA side. Orders will be sent directly back to the relevant branch's POS for processing. This platform aims to expand our reach, streamline online order management, and improve the customer experience through convenience and real-time updates.

## 3. Product Vision

The vision for the [Your Company Name] Online Store PWA is to become the leading digital channel for our customers in Kyiv to easily and conveniently order our products. By leveraging our existing POS infrastructure, we will provide a seamless experience for both customers and our operational staff. The PWA will be fast, reliable, and accessible on any device, reflecting the quality and service of our brand.

*   **Purpose:** To provide customers with a user-friendly online platform to browse, order, and receive products from our 6 Kyiv branches.
*   **Users:**
    *   **Customers:** Individuals in Kyiv wanting to order products for delivery or pickup.
    *   **Admins/Staff:** Internal users needing to manage PWA-specific content (e.g., product descriptions, images) and monitor orders (indirectly via POS).
*   **Business Goals:**
    *   Increase sales revenue by providing an online ordering option.
    *   Expand customer reach beyond physical foot traffic.
    *   Improve operational efficiency by integrating online orders directly into the POS workflow.
    *   Enhance customer satisfaction through a convenient ordering process and timely notifications.
    *   Utilize existing POS data infrastructure to minimize data redundancy and management overhead.

## 4. User Personas

**Persona 1: Anna, The Busy Professional**

*   **Goals:**
    *   Browse products online before visiting the branch.
    *   Place an order for pickup at his local branch.
    *   Select a specific branch for pickup easily.
    *   Receive a clear notification when his pickup order is ready.
*   **Pain Points:**
    *   Needing to call the branch to place a pickup order or confirm stock.
    *   Uncertainty about the preparation time for pickup orders.

## 5. Feature Specifications

### 5.1. POS Integration - Product Catalog

*   **Description:** Fetch product data (name, price, description, category, identifiers) from the POS API. Allow administrators to override specific presentation details (like description, images, additional attributes) within the PWA without affecting the POS data.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a customer, I can browse the current product catalog available online.
    *   As a system, the product catalog is automatically updated from the POS API periodically.
    *   As an admin, I can view products fetched from the POS system.
    *   As an admin, I can edit specific fields for a product (e.g., add a better description, upload a web-specific image) that will be displayed *instead* of the POS data on the PWA.
    *   As a customer, I see the admin-modified product information if it exists.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The PWA backend successfully connects to the POS API product endpoint.
    *   Product data (ID, Name, Price, relevant descriptions/details from POS) is fetched and stored in the PWA database.
    *   A scheduled job runs regularly (e.g., hourly, daily - define frequency based on API limits and data change rate) to sync product data from the POS.
    *   The PWA database includes fields to store admin-defined overrides for product attributes (e.g., `pwa_description`, `pwa_image_url`, `pwa_seo_title`).
    *   If a `pwa_` field is populated for a product, the PWA uses this value; otherwise, it defaults to the data fetched from the POS.
    *   An administrative interface is available to view products and edit the PWA-specific override fields.
    *   Deleted/archived products in POS are marked as unavailable or removed from the PWA catalog upon sync.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   POS API is unavailable or returns errors during sync.
    *   POS API schema changes require PWA sync logic updates.
    *   Product data from POS is incomplete or malformed (e.g., missing price). Default values or error handling needed.
    *   Admin overrides conflict with critical POS data (e.g., trying to override price - this should likely be prevented). Clarify which fields can be overridden. Suggest allowing override of name, description, images, perhaps categories *within the PWA context*. Price *must* come from POS.
    *   Handling a very large product catalog regarding sync time and performance.

### 5.2. POS Integration - Client Data (Optional initial scope)

*   **Description:** (Consider as a Fast Follow or Phase 2) Sync client data from the POS API to allow existing customers to potentially log in or have their data pre-filled if they use the same contact information.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As an existing customer, I can potentially link my online account to my in-store profile.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   (If implemented) PWA backend connects to POS API client endpoint.
    *   Client data (e.g., Name, Phone, Email, Loyalty Info) is synced, respecting privacy regulations.
    *   Logic to match existing PWA users with POS clients based on unique identifiers (e.g., phone number, email).
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   Data privacy compliance (GDPR/local equivalents).
    *   Matching conflicts (multiple POS clients with the same contact info).
    *   POS API does not expose client data or required endpoints.

### 5.3. Multi-Branch Support & Location Services

*   **Description:** Define the 6 branch locations in Kyiv. Allow customers to interact with the system based on proximity to these branches for delivery and pickup options.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a customer, I can see a list or map of the 6 branch locations with addresses and opening hours (if available).
    *   As a customer, I can enter my address (or allow geolocation) to determine service availability and nearest branch.
    *   As a customer, the system identifies the primary branch associated with my order based on my location (for delivery) or selection (for pickup).
    *   As a customer ordering for pickup, I can select one of the available branches.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   PWA configuration/database stores data for the 6 branches (Name, Address, Latitude, Longitude, maybe Contact Info, Operating Hours).
    *   A mechanism for the user to input their address (autocomplete recommended).
    *   Integration with a geocoding service (e.g., Google Maps Geocoding API, Mapbox Geocoding) to convert the address to coordinates.
    *   Logic to calculate the distance between the user's location coordinates and each branch's coordinates. This should ideally be driving distance, but straight-line (haversine formula) can be a simpler initial implementation if driving distance API calls are costly or complex. *Decision needed: Driving distance API or straight-line? Start with straight-line, note driving distance as a desirable enhancement.*
    *   Algorithm to determine the 'nearest' branch based on calculated distance.
    *   UI clearly indicates the nearest branch or the user's selected pickup branch.
    *   Validation that the user's location is within a service area (e.g., within Kyiv city limits, or a defined radius around branches).
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   User provides an invalid or ambiguous address.
    *   Geocoding service fails or returns inaccurate coordinates.
    *   User location is outside the defined service area of all branches.
    *   Multiple branches are very close, requiring a tie-breaking rule or allowing user selection.
    *   Performance issues with distance calculations if done client-side or with many branches (less likely with only 6).
    *   Privacy concerns with geolocation (must ask user permission).

### 5.4. Ordering Process - Cart & Checkout

*   **Description:** Standard e-commerce flow allowing users to add products to a cart, review, and proceed to checkout.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a customer, I can add products to a shopping cart.
    *   As a customer, I can view the contents of my cart, including product details and quantities.
    *   As a customer, I can update product quantities or remove items from my cart.
    *   As a customer, I can proceed from the cart to the checkout process.
    *   As a customer, I must select either "Delivery" or "Pickup" as my fulfillment method during checkout.
    *   As a customer, I provide necessary contact information (Name, Phone, Email - depending on POS API requirements and if client sync isn't used).
    *   As a customer selecting Delivery, I provide my delivery address.
    *   As a customer selecting Pickup, I confirm or select the desired branch location.
    *   As a customer, I see a summary of my order, including products, fulfillment method, calculated delivery fee (if applicable), and total price.
    *   As a customer, I can confirm and place the order.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Functional shopping cart persistence (e.g., using Local Storage or backend).
    *   Clear display of cart items, quantities, individual product prices, and subtotal.
    *   Validation of product availability (basic check based on synced catalog) and minimum/maximum quantities.
    *   Checkout steps are clear and guide the user through selecting fulfillment and providing details.
    *   Delivery address input with validation (e.g., required fields).
    *   Pickup branch selection (dropdown or map interface).
    *   Order summary page correctly calculates and displays all costs, including the delivery fee based on rules.
    *   A confirmation button to place the order.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   User abandons the cart during checkout.
    *   Product price or availability changes between adding to cart and checkout (ideally re-validate on checkout).
    *   Invalid or incomplete delivery address provided.
    *   User location is outside the delivery radius for the selected branch (if delivery is chosen).
    *   Session expires during checkout.
    *   Stock availability issues (if POS syncs stock levels - this needs clarification, assume no real-time stock check initially).

### 5.5. Delivery Fee Calculation

*   **Description:** Calculate the delivery fee based on the distance from the designated branch to the customer's delivery address using the specified rules.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a customer choosing delivery, I see the calculated delivery fee added to my order total.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The system determines the distance (using the same method as nearest branch calculation, ideally driving distance) from the selected/nearest branch to the delivery address coordinates.
    *   Delivery fee is calculated based on the following rules:
        *   0 km to 2 km (inclusive): 99 UAH
        *   > 2 km to 3 km (inclusive): 99 UAH
        *   > 3 km: 99 UAH + (distance in km - 3) * 30 UAH (rounded up to the nearest km for the extra charge calculation, or use fractional km? *Clarification needed: "every km costs +30 uah" - is it per whole km *over* 3, or per fractional km? Assume per fractional km for more accuracy initially: `max(0, distance_km - 3) * 30`). Let's refine the rule: `IF distance_km <= 2 THEN 99 UAH; IF distance_km > 2 AND distance_km <= 3 THEN 99 UAH; IF distance_km > 3 THEN 99 + (distance_km - 3) * 30 UAH;` Use `distance_km` with decimals for the calculation.
    *   The calculated fee is clearly displayed in the order summary.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   Distance calculation returns zero or a negative number (should not happen with correct coordinates).
    *   Geocoding fails, preventing distance calculation.
    *   Distance is extremely large (implies address is outside service area, should be caught by location validation).
    *   Rounding rules for distance and fee calculation need explicit definition (e.g., round distance up to next km before calculation, or use precise distance?). Use precise distance for calculation `(distance_km - 3) * 30`, round *final fee* to 2 decimal places? Or is UAH non-decimal? Assume UAH can have kopecks, round to 2 decimal places.

### 5.6. POS Integration - Order Sending

*   **Description:** Upon successful order placement (and potentially payment confirmation - *note: payment integration is not explicitly detailed in the prompt but is a necessary part of e-commerce. Assume payment happens before or is initiated before sending to POS*), send the order details to the POS system associated with the selected branch via API.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a customer, my order is sent to the correct branch for fulfillment immediately after I place it.
    *   As a system, the PWA backend successfully transmits the order details to the designated POS API endpoint.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   An API call is triggered to the POS system after order confirmation.
    *   The API payload includes all necessary order details in the format required by the POS API (e.g., products, quantities, prices, total amount, customer information, fulfillment method (delivery/pickup), delivery address (if applicable), selected branch ID).
    *   The API call is directed to the specific endpoint/instance corresponding to the selected branch.
    *   The system handles successful and unsuccessful API responses (e.g., retry logic, error logging).
    *   The customer receives an order confirmation message on the PWA after the API call is successfully initiated or completed.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   POS API is down, slow, or returns an error when attempting to send the order. (Need retry mechanism and/or notification to staff/customer).
    *   Order data format is rejected by the POS API.
    *   Network issues prevent the API call.
    *   Duplicate order creation if the API call is accidentally triggered multiple times.
    *   Handling different order types/flags required by the POS (e.g., 'online order', 'pickup', 'delivery').
    *   What happens if payment succeeds but sending to POS fails? (Critical error handling needed).

### 5.7. Notifications

*   **Description:** Inform customers about the status of their order via notifications (presumably PWA push notifications, email, or SMS - *clarify preferred method*). Focus on key statuses.
*   **User Stories:**
    *   As a customer, I receive a notification when my order is successfully placed.
    *   As a customer, I receive a notification when the branch confirms my order.
    *   As a customer, I receive a notification when the status of my order changes (e.g., "Preparing", "Out for Delivery", "Ready for Pickup", "Completed", "Cancelled").
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Integration with a notification service (e.g., Web Push API for PWA, email service, SMS gateway). *Assume PWA Push Notifications as primary.*
    *   Backend logic to trigger notifications based on order status changes. Order status changes will likely originate from the POS system (via webhooks from POS, or polling POS API status endpoints - *API instructions will clarify this*).
    *   Notifications are sent to the customer associated with the order.
    *   Notification content is informative (e.g., "Your order #123 status updated to 'Ready for Pickup'").
    *   Users are prompted to allow push notifications upon first visit or interaction.
*   **Edge Cases:**
    *   User has notifications disabled at the browser or device level.
    *   Notification service is down or experiences delays.
    *   Order status updates from POS are not received or are delayed/incorrect.
    *   Handling different notification types and ensuring appropriate content for each status.
    *   Cost implications of SMS notifications if used.

## 6. Technical Requirements

*   **PWA Architecture:** Implementation using standard PWA technologies (Service Workers for offline capabilities/speed, Web App Manifest for installability, HTTPS).
*   **Backend Framework:** Choice of backend language/framework (e.g., Node.js, Python/Django/Flask, PHP/Laravel, Ruby on Rails, .NET) to handle API integrations, data storage, business logic, and serving the PWA.
*   **Frontend Framework:** Choice of frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue, Angular, Svelte) or plain JavaScript for building the user interface.
*   **POS API Integration:**
    *   Clear API documentation from the POS vendor is required, detailing endpoints for:
        *   Fetching Product Data (list, details).
        *   Fetching Client Data (if syncing clients).
        *   Sending Order Data (creating new order, specifying branch, adding items, customer info, delivery details).
        *   Polling or receiving Order Status Updates (webhooks are preferable if POS supports them).
    *   API Authentication/Authorization method (API keys, OAuth, etc.).
    *   Error handling and retry mechanisms for API calls.
    *   Data mapping and transformation between PWA data models and POS API format.
*   **Database:** A relational (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) or NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) database to store PWA-specific data:
    *   Product overrides (descriptions, images, etc.).
    *   Branch locations and details.
    *   User accounts (if not solely relying on POS client data).
    *   Order history (potentially, if not solely relying on fetching from POS every time).
    *   Configuration settings.
*   **Geocoding & Distance Service:** Integration with a third-party service (e.g., Google Maps Platform, Mapbox, OpenStreetMap Nominatim/OSRM) for converting addresses to coordinates and calculating distances (ideally driving distance). API keys and usage costs need consideration.
*   **Push Notification Service:** Integration with a service supporting Web Push notifications (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging - FCM, or a standalone Web Push library/service).
*   **Payment Processing:** Integration with a payment gateway is essential for e-commerce. This requires separate technical integration (API calls, handling callbacks/webhooks). *This was not explicitly detailed in the prompt but is required for a functional e-commerce site.*
*   **Admin Interface:** Development of a secure web interface for administrators to manage product overrides, branch information, and potentially view PWA-specific order details or analytics.
*   **Hosting:** Reliable hosting environment for the backend application, database, and static PWA files.
*   **Security:** Implement standard web security practices (HTTPS, input validation, protecting API keys, secure authentication).
*   **Monitoring & Logging:** Set up monitoring for application performance, errors, and API integration issues.

## 7. Implementation Roadmap

This roadmap suggests a phased approach, starting with core functionality and adding features iteratively.

**Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**

*   **Focus:** Core e-commerce flow, basic POS integration (Products & Orders), Pickup option, Manual branch selection.
*   **Features:**
    *   PWA setup (Manifest, Service Worker basics).
    *   Product Catalog display (read-only sync from POS API).
    *   Basic Product Detail pages.
    *   Shopping Cart functionality.
    *   Checkout process (collect customer info).
    *   Manual Branch Selection for pickup.
    *   Placeholder/simple Delivery option (maybe just a toggle, no distance calculation yet).
    *   POS Order Sending integration (basic data format).
    *   Order Confirmation page.
    *   Basic Admin interface for viewing synced products.
*   **Outcome:** A functional PWA where customers can browse products, add to cart, choose pickup at a specific branch (or select "delivery" without real calculation), and place orders that are sent to the POS.

**Phase 2: Location & Delivery Logic**

*   **Focus:** Implementing location-based features and the defined delivery rules.
*   **Features:**
    *   Branch data setup and display.
    *   User location input and Geocoding integration.
    *   Distance calculation (straight-line initially) between user and branches.
    *   Nearest branch identification.
    *   Delivery option fully enabled with distance calculation.
    *   Implementation of Delivery Fee Calculation rules (0-2km, >3km logic).
    *   Display calculated delivery fee and total in checkout.
    *   Basic user accounts/profiles (optional, if not syncing clients).
    *   Admin Product Override functionality.
*   **Outcome:** Customers can use location services, the correct delivery fee is calculated, and admins can tweak product presentation.

**Phase 3: Notifications & Refinements**

*   **Focus:** Improving the customer experience with notifications and refining existing features.
*   **Features:**
    *   Push Notification service integration.
    *   Triggering notifications for key order statuses (Order Placed, Ready for Pickup, Out for Delivery, Completed, Cancelled). Requires mechanism to get status updates from POS (polling or webhooks).
    *   Refine distance calculation (upgrade to driving distance API).
    *   Implement POS Client data sync (if needed and feasible).
    *   Order History view for logged-in users.
    *   Enhanced Admin features (e.g., viewing orders sent via PWA, managing branches).
*   **Outcome:** Customers are kept informed about their order status, delivery calculations are more accurate, and administrative control is improved.

**Phase 4: Enhancements & Optimization**

*   **Focus:** Adding value-added features, performance optimization, and potentially integrating payment.
*   **Features:**
    *   Payment Gateway Integration (if not done earlier - *critical for a real e-commerce site*).
    *   Stock availability display (if POS API supports real-time or near-real-time stock levels).
    *   Ratings and Reviews system.
    *   Promotions and Discounts display (sync from POS or manage separately).
    *   Customer Loyalty program integration (if applicable and supported by POS API).
    *   Performance optimization (caching, image optimization, etc.).
    *   Advanced analytics integration.
*   **Outcome:** A more robust, feature-rich, and performant e-commerce platform.

This PRD provides a foundation. Detailed API instructions from the POS vendor are crucial for the technical implementation sections, particularly Feature 5.6 and 5.7's dependency on how POS handles order creation and status updates via API. The payment integration also needs a dedicated requirement section once details are available.
